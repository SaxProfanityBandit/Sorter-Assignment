## Sorting Assignment

A simple sort assignment for my current education (Nov 2021)

SortMain.java will create an JOptionPane for you to enter a comma seperated int array.

SortTest.java can be run without arguments and will try the sorting of 5 pre-defined arrays, however you can give it commandline arguments if you want to try to sort another array. These are seperated by spaces so each int is an argument (using args[]).


## Folder Structure - Pregened by VSCode

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
